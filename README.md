# A coupled soilscape–hydro-biogeochemical evolution model: framework and preliminary applications

### The Land Earth System (LESTM) V1.0 is an integrated simulation platform that couples landscape evolution, hydrological cycling, soil production and erosion, and biogeochemical element cycling. Leveraging high‐resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and driven by coupled physicochemical weathering and flow‐power processes, it dynamically reconstructs atmospheric deposition, bedrock weathering, hydrological flows, vegetation dynamics, and soil development across both spatial and temporal scales. The model supports iterative, year‐by‐year simulations over multi‐decadal periods and integrates material cycling processes across scales. It is applicable to regional‐scale assessments of soil nutrient status and pollution risk, terrain evolution forecasting, and the quantitative evaluation of terrestrial ecosystem services under changing climates.
